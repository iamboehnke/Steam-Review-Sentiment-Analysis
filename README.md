# Steam-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
A machine learning model to analyze and classify millions of Steam game reviews as either positive or negative.

This project is a sentiment analysis deep dive into millions of Steam reviews. By processing a massive dataset of over 6.4 million reviews, I've developed a machine learning model that accurately classifies new reviews as either positive or negative.

The Jupyter Notebook walks through the entire process, including data cleaning, text preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. It highlights key steps such as tokenization, vectorization, and building a deep neural network to understand the nuances of review text.

This repository serves as a practical example of how to tackle a real-world text classification problem, showcasing the power of machine learning in understanding user feedback at scale. It can be used as a starting point for anyone interested in natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, or applying machine learning to large text datasets.
